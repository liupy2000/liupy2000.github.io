# üôã‚Äç‚ôÇ <font color="#4A708B">About</font>
I am a Research Engineer in the Department of Industrial Systems Engineering and Management at the ‚Äã‚ÄãNational University of Singapore‚Äã, advised by Dr. [Nan Chen](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/isem/staff/chen-nan-2/).
My research interests include functional data analysis, tensor decomposition, Gaussian process, state space model, and Bayesian network in the areas of advanced manufacturing and medical testing. I have published papers or received major revisions at top-tier international journals in the fields of Quality, Statistics & Reliability, such as Technometrics, IISE Transactions, Journal of Quality Technology, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering ([Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=VKBRUmsAAAAJ)). My research has been recognized with several prestigious awards, including ICQSR, INFORMS-DMDA, INFORMS-QSR, IISE-QCRE, and QRSE.

**<font color="#990000">I am actively seeking a position as a tenure-tracked Assistant Professor in 2025. If you have any information, please contact me!</font>**
